This project keeps only the working test files in the test/ tree. All duplicate .js test files generated by TypeScript or previous runs are removed. Only .ts files are kept for editing and running with Jasmine + ts-node/register.

If you need to regenerate .js files, run the TypeScript build. But for Jasmine, only .ts files are needed.
